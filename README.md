# House_price_prediction

This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning regression techniques. The dataset includes features like as location, number of bedrooms, size in square feet and many more. It's designed to show the full data science lifecycle data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning


## Dataset

The dataset used includes housing information such as:
  Location
  Number of bedrooms, bathrooms
  Total square footage (SQFT)
  Price per square foot (PRICE_PER_SQFT)
  Target: Price



### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

### 2. Model Training

Three models were trained and evaluated:
  Linear regression 
  Random forest regressor
  XGBoost regressor

### 3. Best Model Performance

### 4. Hyperparameter Tuning (XGBoost)

### 5. Cross Validation (Random Forest)

### 6. Feature Importance
